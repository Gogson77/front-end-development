    <h2>Personal Life</h2>
    <p>Tesla worked every day from 9:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. or later, with dinner from exactly 8:10 p.m.,
        at Delmonico's restaurant and later the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Tesla would telephone his dinner
        order to the headwaiter, who also could be the only one to serve him. "The meal was required to be ready
        at eight o'clock ... He dined alone, except on the rare occasions when he would give a dinner to a group
        to meet his social obligations. Tesla would then resume his work, often until 3:00 a.m.".</p>
    <p>For exercise, Tesla walked between 8 and 10 miles (13 and 16 km) per day. He curled his toes one hundred
        times for each foot every night, saying that it stimulated his brain cells.</p>
    <p>In an interview with newspaper editor Arthur Brisbane, Tesla said that he did not
        believe in telepathy, stating, "Suppose I made up my mind to murder you," he said,
        "In a second you would know it. Now, isn't that wonderful? By what process does the
        mind get at all this?" In the same interview, Tesla said that he believed that all
        fundamental laws could be reduced to one.</p>
    <h2>Eidetic memory</h2>
    <p>Tesla read many works, memorizing complete books, and supposedly possessed a photographic memory.He
        was a polyglot, speaking eight languages: Serbo-Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian,
        Italian, and Latin. Tesla related in his autobiography that he experienced detailed moments of inspiration.
        During his early life, Tesla was repeatedly stricken with illness. He suffered a peculiar affliction in which
        blinding flashes of light would appear before his eyes, often accompanied by visions.Often, the visions were
        linked to a word or idea he might have come across; at other times they would provide the solution to a
        particular problem he had encountered. Just by hearing the name of an item, he would be able to envision
        it in realistic detail.Tesla would visualize an invention in his mind with extreme precision, including all
        dimensions, before moving to the construction stage, a technique sometimes known as picture thinking.
        He typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory. Beginning in his childhood, Tesla had
        frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in his life.</p>
    <h2>Sleep habits</h2>
    <p>Tesla claimed never to sleep more than two hours per night.However, he did admit to "dozing" from time
        to time "to recharge his batteries." During his second year of study at Graz, Tesla developed
        a passionate proficiency for billiards, chess, and card-playing, sometimes spending more than 48 hours
        in a stretch at a gaming table. On one occasion at his laboratory, Tesla worked for a period of 84 hours
        without rest.Kenneth Swezey, a journalist whom Tesla had befriended, confirmed that Tesla rarely slept.
        Swezey recalled one morning when Tesla called him at 3 a.m.: "I was sleeping in my room like one dead ...
        Suddenly, the telephone ring awakened me ... [Tesla] spoke animatedly, with pauses, [as he] ... work[ed]
        out a problem, comparing one theory to another, commenting; and when he felt he had arrived at the solution,
        he suddenly closed the telephone."</p>
