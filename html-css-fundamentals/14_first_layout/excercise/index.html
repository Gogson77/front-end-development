		<h1>Miloš Crnjanski</h1>

		<p>Miloš Crnjanski <span class="bi">(October 1893 – 30 November 1977)</span> was a poet of the expressionist
			wing of Serbian modernism, author, and a diplomat. From his beginnings as a journalist whose
			social-political stance
			was at one moment openly opposed to freedom and progress, he gradually arose to become a poet and
			romanticist.

			<p>Crnjanski was born in Csongrad, Hungary, to an impoverished family which moved in 1896 to Temesvar
				(Romania), where he grew up in a patriarchal-patriotic community with the implanted cult of Serbia and
				Serbian heritage in his soul as a precious relic.</p>
