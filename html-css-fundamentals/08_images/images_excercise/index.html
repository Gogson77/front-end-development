        <strong>Nikola Tesla</strong> (<em>10 July 1856 â€“ 7 January 1943</em>) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical
        engineer, mechanical engineer, physicist, and futurist who is best known for his contributions to the design of
        the modern <u>alternating current</u><u> (AC)</u><u> electricity supply system.</u>
    </p>

    <p>
        Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla received an advanced education in engineering and physics in the
        1870s and gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the
        new electric power industry. He emigrated to the United States in 1884, where he would become a naturalized
        citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his
        own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to
        develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related
        polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and
        became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company would eventually market.
    </p>
    <p>Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with
        mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a
        wireless-controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and would
        demonstrate his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at
        public lectures.
        Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power
        distribution in his high-voltage,high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he
        made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these
        ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication
        and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.
    </p>
    <p>After Wardenclyffe, Tesla went on to try to develop a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying
        degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, he lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind
        unpaid bills. Tesla died in New York City in January 1943. His work fell into relative obscurity following his
        death,
        but in 1960, the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the SI unit of magnetic flux density the tesla
        in
        his honor. There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s
